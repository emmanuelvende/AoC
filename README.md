## Thoughts

>_"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability."_
― John Woods

>_"I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits."_
― Kent Beck

>_"First, solve the problem.
Then, write the code."_
― John Johnson


My motivation is to achieve puzzles certainly as fast as I can (and I'm not so quick as I would :persevere:), but also with the more readable and matainable code I can write for this kind of game. Remember that I don't consider this as professional code so variables names, design choices, etc. remain primarily driven by the need to resolve fast...

I keep this solves under my pillow to consult as useful examples code base when I fall on similar problems as coding in my every day job :+1:

Due to schedulings and other occupations I cannot assume true competition even on private leaderboards (in addition in France I'm released new puzzles at 6 AM :grin:).

Hope you'll get some fun reading my solutions :bouquet:
