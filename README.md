>_"First, solve the problem.
Then, write the code."_

My motivation is to achieve puzzles certainly as fast as I can (and I'm not so quick as I would :persevere:), but also with the more maintainable and shareable code I can write.

I keep this solves under my pillow to consult as useful examples code base when I fall on similar problems as coding in my every day job :+1:

Due to schedulings and other occupations I cannot assume true competition on main leaderboard (in addition in France I'm released new puzzles at 6 AM :grin:). I would be glad for any comments on my solutions since I know they're certainly not the best one could publish.

Hope you'll get some learning reading my solutions :bouquet:
