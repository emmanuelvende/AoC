# AoC-2022
My participation to Advent of Code 2022


>_"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live"_

â€• John Woods

My motivation is to achieve puzzles certainly as fast as I can (and I'm not so quick as I would :), but also with the more maintainable and shareable code I can write.

I keep this solves under my pillow to consult as useful examples code base when I fall on similar problems as coding in my every day job.

Due to schedulings and other occupations I cannot assume true competition on main leaderboard (for me new puzzles are published at 6 AM). I would be glad for any comments on my solutions since I know they're certainly not the best one could publish.

Hope you'll get some learning reading my solutions.
